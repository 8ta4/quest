      You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good
      people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little
      money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one
      of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three
      are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily
      makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard,
      but doable.

      If there is one message I'd like to get across about startups, that's it.
      There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.
    </p>
    <p>The Idea</p>
    <p>
      In particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around.
      The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than
      they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn't
      take brilliance to do better.
