# quest

## Goals

### Random Access

> Can you freely move between sections when using `quest` for reading?

Yep, with `quest`, you can jump around between sections as you like. It keeps track of where you've been, so you don't have to remember what you've already read. This way, you can explore at your own pace and follow your curiosity.

### Keyboard

> Can you control `quest` entirely with your keyboard?

Absolutely, you can navigate `quest` entirely using keyboard shortcuts. It's quicker and helps you stay in the zone.

> Do `quest`'s shortcuts conflict with Vimium?

Nope, `quest`'s shortcuts are designed to avoid any conflicts with Vimium.

## Functionality

### Navigation

> Is navigation undoable in `quest`?

No, you can't undo navigation in `quest`. It follows a similar approach to Vim.

### Data

> Does `quest` generate questions?

Nope, `quest` doesn't generate questions. Even though AI might get there someday, it's been pretty tough to make sure the questions meet specific requirements right now.

> Does `quest` autosave?

Yes, `quest` autosaves your progress. It's like they say, "It's better to be saved than sorry." You can just stay focused on what you're reading.

> Why choose YAML over JSON for import files?

YAML is chosen over JSON because:

- You can add comments.

- It doesn't need extra commas, so it's easier to edit.

> Why the `.yaml` and not `.yml`?

The YAML FAQ recommends "[using '.yaml' when possible.](https://yaml.org/faq.html#:~:text=Is%20there%20an,yaml%22%20when%20possible.)"
