# quest

## Introduction

> What is this extension?

`quest` is a Chrome extension that transforms the way you read technical content. It offers a Q&A journey, similar to the "Choose Your Own Adventure" approach.

## Getting Started

> How do I install it?

TODO: Add a link to the Chrome Web Store where the quest extension can be installed.

You can install it from [here]().

> How do I try it?

TODO: Add a link to a demo page where users can try out the quest extension.

You can try it on this [demo page]().

> How do I see the answer?

If a question is marked as unseen, pressing `Space` will mark it as seen and reveal its answer. `Space` is chosen because it's used to toggle checkboxes, and "seen" and "Space" both have "s".

> How do I unsee the answer?

`Space` lets you toggle the current question's seen status. If a question is marked as seen, pressing `Space` will mark it as unseen and hide its answer.

> How do I get to the next question?

Press `j` for the next question.

> How do I get to the previous question?

Press `k` for the previous question.

> How do I get to the next unseen question?

Press `Ctrl + j` for the next unseen question.

> How do I get to the previous unseen question?

Press `Ctrl + k` for the previous unseen question.

> How do I undo toggling the seen status?

`Space` lets you toggle the current question's seen status.

Alternatively, you can press `u` to undo it.

> How do I redo my undo?

You can hit `Ctrl + r`.

> Is there an undo limit?

Yes, the undo limit is 1,000 actions.

> Can I read something other than the demo page?

Yep, you just need to import a file. You can load it by pressing `Ctrl + q`. "q" stands for "question".

> How can I use it while using Vimium?

If you press `i`, you will enter Vimium's insert mode, and `quest` will be able to receive keystrokes.

If you want to use Vimium again, you can press `Escape` twice.

> Why do I need to press `Escape` twice?

You press `Escape` once to focus `quest`'s Content Window and press `Escape` once more to exit Vimium's insert mode. Any key excluding `Escape` will focus `quest`'s Question Window. To exit Vimium's insert mode, you first want to focus on the Content Window.

> What's the keyboard shortcut to deactivate this extension?

`Option + r` toggles this extension. Think "r" for "read," similar to a browser's reader mode.
