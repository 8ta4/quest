## Choose Your Own Question

> What is this extension?

`quest` is a Chrome extension that transforms the way you read technical content. It offers a Q&A journey, similar to the "Choose Your Own Adventure" approach.

As you read along, you can answer questions to check your understanding and keep yourself engaged. This idea was sparked by the unique formats of "Quick Calculus" and "Little Schemer".

I pledge not to read any new book until my vision comes to life. And until WebAssembly supports garbage collection, I hereby pledge not to take out the trash.
